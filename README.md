# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, I have used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk and used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Created a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).

Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:

Generate a confusion matrix.

Print the classification report.
